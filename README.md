**`Software Engineer/Writer`**

👋 Hey there! I'm Ilef Boualleg, an aspiring software engineer passionate about pushing the boundaries of technology. From designing efficient algorithms to building full-stack applications, I thrive on turning complex problems into elegant, real-world solutions.
<br>
💡 My journey started with a Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering, and now I’m pursuing an IT engineering diploma at ENSI. Along the way, I’ve explored AI, brain-computer interfaces (BCI), operating systems, numerical methods, and digital transmission, always eager to deepen my expertise.
<br>
🛠️ I build projects from the ground up, combining C, Python, JavaScript, and PHP with structured problem-solving to create impactful software. Whether it’s a bank management system in C, an AI-powered tool for PPP analysis, or a web app that refines user experiences, every project reflects my commitment to growth and innovation.
<br>
🚀 I believe in continuous learning, refining my skills in data structures, algorithms, and software architecture, while also navigating electronics and transistors in my academic journey. My work is driven by curiosity and a desire to engineer solutions that matter.
<br>
🔍 Currently, I’m diving deeper into advanced programming concepts, web development, and AI, crafting projects that challenge me to think critically and code efficiently.

Let’s connect and build something great!

 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Forrest's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I started my coding journey as a naive computer science student with a passion to learn everything I could about this programming world - code, unix, linux, theory. And all the while, teaching myself iOS development with a dream to build my own app, but that soon got overshadowed by my desire to excel in Java. A desire that landed me a full-stack software engineering job upon graduation. However, I had another desire I had been pursuing throughout this time - YouTube content creation. I eventually ended up quitting my software engineering job to pursue YouTube full-time, and that has been my focus ever since. But there's something that's always bothered me about my journey - abandoning my dream of building my own app to pursue the safe route, a job. Now I've already taken the leap away from that safety net into this uncomfortable, unexplored world that it being a creator. And it worked out, but again, it became comfortable. It's easier to create a video than go out on a ledge and build my own product. I do have to eat, at the end of the day, but I think it's time. It's time to get uncomfortable again. I have a burning desire to get back on the horse, and fulfill that dream younger me had of building my own app, my own product. And in order to do that, I'll be implmementing a few measures to streamline my YouTube content to focus more time on fulfilling that dream - a dream that I'll be ready to tackle in 2023 due to the measure I'm putting in place now until the end of 2022. Don't wait up, because I'm coming.
